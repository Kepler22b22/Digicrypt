"""My digital diary, safely locked away... or is it? If you can break the code, you deserve to read them :D """

This toolkit provides a simple and efficient way to encrypt and decrypt messages using modular exponentiation. The encryption is based on a randomly generated prime modulus and encryption exponent.

Files Included

* cipher.h – Core encryption and decryption functions.

* prime_utils.h – Random prime and encryption exponent generation utilities.

* main.cpp – Example implementation demonstrating encryption and decryption.
